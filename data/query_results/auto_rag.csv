The sentiment for AAPL based on recent news is mixed. While the company reported good early results for its loyalty program, the macroeconomic environment is volatile and uneven. The company's revenue performance improved each quarter in 2023, and it is expanding its direct presence in emerging markets. However, the company's revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue, and the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. The company expects iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis, but the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories is expected to decelerate significantly from the September quarter. The company expects the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. The company expects gross margin to be between 45% and 46%. The company expects OpEx to be between \$14.4 billion and \$14.6 billion, and OI&E to be around negative \$200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and its tax-rate to be around 16%. The company's Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of \$0.24 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock\'s price, do they really matter?\nLet\'s take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 36 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 36 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 32 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 88.9% and 8.3% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock\'s future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock\'s price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $10.74.\nAnalysts\' growing optimism over the company\'s earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.'}, {'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nvda-beat-estimates-again-161010077.html', 'title': 'Will Nvidia NVDA Beat Estimates Again in', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-03*', 'text': ""If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Nvidia (NVDA). This company, which is in the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 23.83%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Nvidia came out with earnings of $2.70 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share, representing a surprise of 29.19%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.09 per share, delivering a surprise of 18.48%.\nFor Nvidia, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nNvidia currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.93%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 21, 2023.\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The SEC\'s subpoena exceeds the agency\'s investigative authority, is overly burdensome and seeks ""irrelevant evidence"", Musk\'s lawyers said in the filing.\nThe SEC has said it was investigating Musk\'s 2022 purchases of Twitter stock and his statements and SEC filings relating to Twitter -- which Musk subsequently renamed X -- and that Musk had refused to attend a September interview for the probe.\nAlex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, has called the investigation ""misguided.""\nOn Thursday, Spiro and Musk\'s other lawyers said in the filing: ""The SEC’s pursuit of Mr. Musk has crossed the line into harassment"".\nThe SEC did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The agency has previously said it is well within its authority to seek additional testimony from Musk and that it has received new documents in the investigation since last interviewing him.\nOn April 4, 2022, Musk disclosed he had acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter. It was 11 days after the SEC\'s deadline for such disclosures. Musk initially said he planned to be a passive stakeholder, meaning he did not plan to take over the company.\nLater that month, he announced plans to buy Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently tried to get out of the deal, alleging Twitter was not disclosing the full extent of bot activity on its platform.\nAfter being sued to complete the deal, Musk closed his acquisition of Twitter in late October 2022.\nMusk has given the SEC documents relating to the probe and provided testimony in July last year via video conference, the SEC said in a court filing. But SEC attorneys said they have more questions for Musk after seeing the documents.\nThe SEC has issued 32 subpoenas in the investigation and has taken testimony from Musk and at least three other individuals seven times, Spiro said in a second filing. Musk alone has received five subpoenas for documents and another three for testimony, he said.\nThe SEC has spent 18 months ""devoting its formidable resources to investigating Mr. Musk over an allegedly untimely filing,"" the court filings said. ""This is just the latest chapter in a more-than-five-year saga of agency harassment against Mr. Musk and related entities.""\nThe court battle is the latest flare up in the acrimonious relationship between the U.S. market regulator and Musk, the world\'s wealthiest person.\nThe SEC sued Musk in 2018 over his posts on social media saying he had ""funding secured"" to take electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc private. Musk settled, but the regulator sued him again in 2019 alleging he had violated the terms of the agreement.\nMusk has meanwhile accused the agency of mounting ""endless"" investigations into him and Tesla.\nHe said he will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the legality of his SEC settlement, which requires him to vet some of his social media posts with a Tesla lawyer.

But in February 2019, testimony at the antitrust trial revealed Tuesday, Google internally declared a “Code Yellow” amid concerns the company might not meet its goals for search revenue for the quarter.\nAs part of the emergency, which lasted for seven weeks, engineers from Google’s search and Chrome browser teams were reassigned to figure out why user queries had slowed, according to the documents.\nBen Gomes, Google’s former head of search, was called by the company in its defense to show that it had made various advancements in search, particularly in mobile. However, cross examination by Justice Department lawyer David Dahlquist revealed the tensions between Gomes’ search team and its advertising counterparts.\nThe questioning sought to undermine Google’s contentions that its search team focuses solely on improving the user experience and has sometimes been pulled into the advertising side, where the Justice Department alleges Google has been able to raise prices without pushback.\nThe trial, now in its eighth week, focuses on whether Google has illegally maintained its monopoly by spending billions of dollars to stifle competition and preserve its monopoly over online search.\nEarlier: Google’s Pichai Refutes DOJ Allegations of Deleting Evidence\nIn a statement, Google pushed back on the idea that search results and innovation were affected by the company’s ad revenue goals. “The organic results you see in search are not affected by our ads systems or by the ads we show for a query,” said Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesperson.\nGoogle argues that it has captured about 90% of the market for search on the merits of a superior product, and that its advancements in internet search have benefited the public. But emails revealed in court on Tuesday showed that there was some concern among key members of the company’s search team that Google was focused on growth over innovation.\nIn a 2019 email, Gomes wrote to other executives that his search team was “getting too close to the money.”\nEmails as Evidence\n“I think it is good for us to aspire to query growth and to aspire to more users. But I think we are getting too involved with ads for the good of the product and company,” Gomes wrote.\n“I am getting concerned that growth is all we are thinking about,” he ended the email.\nQuery growth is measured by looking at the number of user queries, which the Justice Department argued can translate to increased revenue, since greater queries provide more opportunities for Google to run search ads against them.\nGomes testified in court that he was feeling frustrated and sent the email at 6 a.m. At the time, Google set its metrics on the number of user queries, which Gomes said he believed wasn’t a good one since product improvements should help users find answers quickly.\n“I did not care for queries as a metric,” he said. “I think this metric of just using queries is not one that optimizes appropriately.”\nGoogle ended the “Code Yellow” emergency in mid-March.

Based on the recent news, NVDA appears to be a good stock to buy. The company has a strong history of beating earnings estimates, and its recent earnings surprise history has been positive. Additionally, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for NVDA is positive, indicating that another beat is possible. The Zacks Rank for NVDA is also #1 (Strong Buy), which is a good sign. However, it is important to note that the ABR (Average Brokerage Recommendation) for NVDA is 1.13, which is between Strong Buy and Buy. Therefore, it may be beneficial to use the ABR in conjunction with other factors, such as the Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP, when making an investment decision.",16.289499282836914,,"[{'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-nvidia-nvda-based-133006232.html', 'title': 'Is It Worth Investing in Nvidia NVDA Bas', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-03*', 'text': 'Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock\'s price, do they really matter?\nLet\'s take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 36 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 36 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 32 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 88.9% and 8.3% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock\'s future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock\'s price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $10.74.\nAnalysts\' growing optimism over the company\'s earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.'}, {'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nvda-beat-estimates-again-161010077.html', 'title': 'Will Nvidia NVDA Beat Estimates Again in', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-03*', 'text': ""If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Nvidia (NVDA). This company, which is in the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 23.83%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Nvidia came out with earnings of $2.70 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share, representing a surprise of 29.19%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.09 per share, delivering a surprise of 18.48%.\nFor Nvidia, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nNvidia currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.93%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 21, 2023.\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.\nJason Matthew Gerberry\nHi, good afternoon, this is (inaudible) for Jason. We just had a couple of questions on FG-3246. This is based on the activity that you're seeing in the NCR PC patients in the Phase I trial thus far, are you planning to assess 3246 in earlier lines. And I know you're planning to enrich for patients that expressed CD46. Could you just please remind us what percentage of the patient population you expect to be in the subgroup of CD46 expressors? Thank you so much.\nThane Wettig\nJohn?\nJohn J. Hunter\nYeah, in addition to the continued outstanding performance of roxadustat in China, the roxadustat launch in Europe is accelerating, showing robust quarter-over-quarter growth. We expect this growth to continue to accelerate given the strong competitive position of roxadustat. Roxadustat is the only HIF PHI indicated in the EU, thanks for the question. Just with regards to going into earlier lines, the enzalutamide combo study that's being run as an investigator-sponsored trial at UCSF does open the possibility of going into a first-line setting if that is positive. So we are following that carefully to see what those results look like and then we would make a decision, I think, based on those results.Just with regards to the percentage of patients who we expect to be positive we have a pretty limited data set at this point regarding expression by IHC for patients that either do or do not express CD46. We do think that the PET biomarker will give us much better data on that and really kind of guide our thinking. But based on the data that we have in hand right now, we've been estimating between 50% and 70% of the patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer will be CD46 positive. But I do want to stress that we are looking to acquire more data points to sort of firm that number up.And we won't be enriching in the Phase II trial. We're going to be assessing the patients ahead of treatment with our CD-46 and then once the efficacy results are in, then we'll do a correlation with the PET positivity and in the efficacy results.\nJason Matthew Gerberry\nGot it. And just a quick follow-up. Just thinking more broadly, kind of your strategy for this, Fortis potential acquisition during the next 4-year period, you have, obviously, success in this (inaudible) trial will be important. But do you have any plans to assess this indication or this asset in other indications in the next 4 years?\nJohn J. Hunter\nYes, we do. We've got the plans to do a tumor expansion trial as well. And it's just a matter of determining exactly when the right time is to do that tumor expansion trial, whether we go ahead and pull the trigger on it earlier or wait until we see some sort of an efficacy signal in the Phase II trial. We'll make that call at some point in the future. But yes, there are definitely plans and you heard John speak about multiple myeloma in his remarks as well.\nJason Matthew Gerberry\nThank you John.\nOperator\nThank you, I'll now hand the call back over to CEO, Thane Wettig, for any closing remarks.\nThane Wettig\nWell, thanks, everybody. We appreciate your participation in today's investor call and your interest in FibroGen. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating.

(NASDAQ: DXCM), a global leader in real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) for people with diabetes, announced today new market research which found 79% of people struggle to keep their glucose levels in range, and that almost half (45%) don’t understand what a Hybrid Closed Loop System (HCL) is or how HCL could benefit them1-2. Findings also showed that 99% of healthcare providers expect the NICE TA for HCL systems will somewhat or significantly help change the lives of people living with type 1 diabetes for the better1-2.\nDexcom’s research follows the new Technology Appraisal (TA) from NICE which provides detailed guidance for hybrid closed loop systems usage. The new TA impacts an eligible population of over 150,000 people living with Type 1 diabetes in England, providing access to HCL systems3. Those eligible include people living with type 1 diabetes who are under the age of 18 or those who are over 18 with either an HbA1c of 7.5% or who are experiencing disabling hypoglycaemia, the TA also impacts women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, and people already using an insulin pump3.\nSometimes known as an ‘artificial pancreas’, an HCL system works by linking an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with a computer algorithm that can calculate the amount of insulin someone needs based on their blood glucose readings.\n""It\'s a cause for celebration that hybrid closed loop systems are now a possibility for around 150,000 people with type 1 diabetes"" says Partha Kar, National Specialty Advisor, Diabetes with NHS England. ""This guidance would not have been possible without the support of our industry partners investing in new innovations and advancing technology for diabetes management. Today we are one step closer to providing access to life changing technology for more people with diabetes.""\nKaren Baxter, VP for UK Ireland Benelux Spain and France for Dexcom comments: ""It is clear from our research1-2 that so many more people could benefit from HCL. Every single person (100%) surveyed with type 1 diabetes said that being on an HCL system has reduced the burden of managing their diabetes and 98% of healthcare practitioners say they would want all people with type 1 diabetes to have access to HCL. The newly announced TA from NICE3 is a great advancement in access to diabetes technology.\n""As such, to support healthcare professionals with their understanding of the benefits of HCL systems for patients with diabetes, Dexcom has worked with the clinical experts at the Diabetes Technology Network (DTN) to launch a series of education modules encompassing everything they need to know about the technology, we are excited to play a key role in widening access to HCL as a result.""\nCelebrity Dexcom Warrior and HCL user, actor Jeremy Irvine† comments: ""I can honestly say using the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring device to power my HCL system has changed my life. I can’t imagine going back to finger pricks* and blood glucose monitoring, and I certainly couldn’t do the intense filming I’ve been doing without my HCL system.""\nDexcom is the most connected continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) brand in the world7, it is backed by over 28 studies8‡§, has powered HCL systems for over one million years of cumulative patient use7, and is a critical and essential component of an HCL system.'}]"
