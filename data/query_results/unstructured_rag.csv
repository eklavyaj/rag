2023-12-01 23:06:43.619267,Asses AAPL's latest performance,"

Taking a step back, as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was \$383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant-currency basis despite the volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment. Our year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year, and so did our earnings per share performance, as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. And we continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets and the opportunity ahead of us. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call.
The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point. As a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. For clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having one less week this year, we expect our December quarter, total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week.
We expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the Wearable category, last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. For our Services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46%.
We expect OpEx to be between \$14.4 billion and \$14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative \$200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax-rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of \$0.24 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions.

This company, which is in the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 23.83%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Nvidia came out with earnings of $2.70 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share, representing a surprise of 29.19%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.09 per share, delivering a surprise of 18.48%.\nFor Nvidia, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nNvidia currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.93%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 21, 2023.\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

These are assets that have long reserve lives, high grades, low cost, consistent performance and significant exploration potential, which allows you to have this performance over time. And I'll suggest to you that Greens Creek checks all five of those boxes; long reserve lives, high grade, low cost, consistent performance and significant exploration potential. Lucky Friday at this point, checks four of the five. Casa and Keno checks three of them, but all the mines check the long lives. So we are focusing on setting up the mines for the long-term, pushing for continuous improvement and allowing innovation to fundamentally improve them. So they all end up, I'm convinced all of them will end up checking all five of the boxes.\nSo with that context for the quarter, let me move to Slide 4, and I'll start with the Lucky Friday, which will not have production until early 2024 as we block off the lower part of the two shaft and build a new secondary escapeway of ventilation raise. And this three month project is going well. At the same time, we are still advancing other projects and completing our equipment purchases. We actually have 10 pieces of equipment on surface that are ready to go underground. And we expect to ramp back up to full production in Q1 and see the Lucky Friday continue in 2024, the production growth and the free cash flow that we saw before the fire. Now at Keno Hill, production has been slowed due to the delay in the shotcrete plant commissioning just yesterday in the cement rockfill plant scheduled to be completed later this month.\nTheir completion puts us in a position to advance development and production faster. And the grade of the ore has even been better than what our block model had predicted. However, we are concerned with the safety culture at Keno. Our all-injury frequency rate at Keno is around four, which is not acceptable. If you look at Greens Creek and Lucky Friday, they are both less than one. In the last two months and more recently in the last two weeks, we've had some near misses that didn't result in an injury or damage to equipment that they could have, and that's not acceptable to us. As a result, I've tasked Carlos and his team to methodically review all our process and procedures to get safety right because we know that excellent safety not only prevents injury, but also standardizes activities which increases predictability and production.\nAnd so the safety review of Keno will likely be to changes in our processes, schedules, equipment, and the way we mine. And to make the mine safer, we will re-engineer certain processes. With the mine just starting up and with its expected long mine life, we must get off on the right foot on safety. So we are going to take whatever time is needed to do that. Greens Creek had another consistent strong operational quarter and we are increasing silver production guidance at the mine. Greens Creek has already generated over a $100 million of free cash flow for the year. Now Casa Berardi had a very good quarter progressing on the transition that we are making for becoming only an open pit mine, reporting cash costs and all-in sustaining costs that are well within guidance and building infrastructure that sets the mine up for success in the next decade.\nEarlier this year, we saw the need to make the fundamental changes, which we began implementing just this past quarter, and we are already seeing the benefits of that.""}]",mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1

Musk stated that while the Cybertruck is a great product, it will take some time before it becomes a significant positive cash flow contributor. This news caused Tesla shares to tumble. Additionally, Tesla's stock has been experiencing a decline over the past two weeks due to concerns about weakening demand for electric cars. Several global automakers and Wall Street analysts have expressed grim commentary about the EV industry, which has weighed on Tesla's stock. The decline in Tesla's stock price has erased about \$130 billion from the company's market capitalization. However, there was a brief rebound in the stock price after Tesla convinced a jury that its Autopilot technology was not responsible for a fatal crash.

That was followed by grim commentary from several global automakers, as well as Wall Street analysts. This week, battery-maker Panasonic Holdings Corp. and chipmaker ON Semiconductor Corp. also sounded alarms for the EV industry.\nThe warnings have weighed on stocks across the US automotive sector, which has also been battling extensive negotiations with its labor unions over wages. Still, Tesla’s decline stands out: shares have sunk over 17% since the Oct. 18 report, compared to a 2.8% drop in the S&P 500 Index, and a 3.4% decline in the Nasdaq 100. The retreat in the EV-maker’s stock price has erased about $130 billion from the company’s market capitalization.\n“At the crux of the problem is a capital-intensive sector investing in unproven EV strategies amid a world of rising costs, lower prices, rising rates and slower demand,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note discussing the wider industry weakness Tuesday. “What investors seem to be waking up to today is the idea that the tens of billions of dollars invested in EVs may be value destructive rather than value accretive.”\nThe outlook for autos overall has been darkening as high interest rates have sent the cost to own a car soaring. When coupled with rising inflation, consumers’ ability to afford big purchases has been squeezed. EVs, still a relatively new technology with an underdeveloped charging ecosystem, are getting hit first.\nAs a pureplay EV maker with an eye-watering valuation, the stakes are high for Tesla. While some part of its expensive share price reflects its potential to develop self-driving cars, a large part depends on the company’s ability to maintain its current dominant position in the EV industry and its profit margins.\nAs EV demand tapers and Tesla’s aggressive price cuts seem to be losing their ability to boost demand much further, investors are starting to get jittery, reflected in the sharp slide in the share price.\nStill, the stock staged a sharp rebound around midday in New York after the company convinced a jury that its Autopilot technology wasn’t responsible for a crash that killed a California driver four years ago.

We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares.

Few doubt that AI tools like ChatGPT will make some jobs obsolete, but opinions vary widely on what the overall impact will be in the long run—even among two of the emergent tech space’s billionaire visionaries.\nIn recent days, Tesla CEO (and OpenAI cofounder) Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang couldn’t have expressed more different visions for the future of the economy, once AI reaches its full potential.\nThe two have known each other for years. Huang (net worth: $38.7 billion) is a Tesla customer and interviewed Musk (net worth: $208 billion) onstage at an 2015 Nvidia event, raving about Musk’s accomplishments with electric vehicles. But since AI exploded onto the scene this year, Nvidia has gained a new prominence thanks to booming demand for its AI chips. Its market cap now exceeds $1 trillion, catapulting over Tesla, which currently sits at $690 billion.\nMusk said in Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call that he has “tremendous respect for Jensen and Nvidia” and that his carmaker is “using a lot of Nvidia hardware,” adding, “We’ll actually take Nvidia hardware as fast as Nvidia will deliver it to us.”\nBut Musk’s view on AI’s potential to replace humans in jobs is decidedly darker than Huang’s.\n“There will come a point where no job is needed,” Musk said on Thursday while sharing a stage with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the UK AI Safety Summit (held fittingly at Bletchley Park, an English estate considered one of modern computing’s birthplaces due to its role in Allied code-breaking during World War II). “You can have a job if you want a job. One of the challenges in the future will be how do we find meaning in life.”\nCalling AI the “most disruptive force in history,” he said we’ll eventually “have something that’s smarter than the smartest human.”\nA few weeks earlier, though, Huang shared his more upbeat outlook about AI in an interview with the Acquired podcast.\n“My sense is that it’s likely to generate jobs,” he said. “The first thing that happens with productivity is prosperity. When the companies get more successful, they hire more people, because they want to expand into more areas.”\nA common line of thinking, he noted, is that if a company improves productivity with AI, then it will employ fewer people. But that assumes a company will have no new ideas, he said, and “that's not true for most companies.”\nSo long as there are more areas to expand into—new ideas in transportation, retail, entertainment, technology, and drug discovery—the prosperity that comes from improved productivity results in more people being hired, he believes. He noted that today’s industries are larger than those of a thousand years ago “because obviously humans have a lot of ideas.”\nHuang does think some people will lose their job due to artificial intelligence, but argues they’ll more likely lose it to another human using AI. “I think jobs will change,” he said, but “my guess is that we’ll actually have higher employment, we’ll create more jobs.”\nThe difference may stem from how Musk seems in general to have a harsher view of employees than Huang does. Another area where they completely disagree is remote work. While Musk has railed against it—suggesting that remote workers “pretend to work”—Huang has no problem with it whatsoever, telling VentureBeat in 2020 that however employees choose mix their work settings, “I’m perfectly comfortable with all that.”\nNvidia has stuck with its remote-work policy; meanwhile, an increasing number of high-profile CEOs have embraced Musk’s line of thinking and issued return-to-office mandates.\nAnd while Musk ruthlessly slashed 80% of the workforce at Twitter after acquiring the company late last year, at one point mocking a fired employee with a disability before backpedaling—he soon faced a flurry of lawsuits and other legal actions over benefits owed and the manner of the terminations—Nvidia avoided the large layoffs seen elsewhere in the tech industry.""}]",mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1
